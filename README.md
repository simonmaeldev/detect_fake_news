# detect_fake_news

This project is an implementation of the fake news detection system described in the tutorial at [https://data-flair.training/blogs/advanced-python-project-detecting-fake-news/](https://data-flair.training/blogs/advanced-python-project-detecting-fake-news/).

## Purpose

This project serves as an exercise to train and improve Python programming skills, particularly in the areas of natural language processing and machine learning. It demonstrates how to build a simple fake news detector using Python and various libraries.
